# Help Center Backend

A help center backend with clean, separated architecture, built with FastAPI, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. CI/CD pipeline with Docker, GitHub Actions, Cloud Run deployment, and UV dependency management.

**Complete Refactoring:**
- **Clean Structure**: Migrated from `helpcenter-*` to clean `common/`, `graphql_api/`, `editor_api/`
- **UV Integration**: Dependency management with `pyproject.toml` and lock files
- **Test Optimization**: Two testing strategy (fast unit tests + comprehensive integration tests)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with path-based triggering and UV caching
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting, formatting, and import sorting
- **Production Ready**: All tests passing with proper alembic migrations

- **Docker Support**: Multi-stage builds for development and production

## Quick Start

Ensure Docker Desktop or Colima is running.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Docker
- Neon DB account
- Google Cloud account

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd helpcenter-backend
cp env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with actual values
```

### 2. Configure Environment

The `env.example` file contains all required environment variables with placeholder values. Copy it to `.env.local` and update with actual values:

- **Database**: Set Neon DB connection details
- **Redis**: For rate limiting (use `redis://redis:6379` for local development)
- **Google Cloud**: Set GCS bucket and service accounts
- **Security**: Generate strong secret keys
- **CORS**: Add frontend domains

### 3. Run with Docker

```bash
# Start development environment
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Run quick tests (no cleanup)
make test-quick
```

### 4. UV

For local development with UV:

```bash
# Setup UV (one-time)
make uv-setup

# Run GraphQL API with UV
make uv-run

# Add dependencies
make uv-add pkg=requests

# Update lock file
make uv-lock
```

## Development

### Available Commands

```bash
make help              # Show all commands
make dev               # Start development environment
make dev-stop          # Stop development environment
make test              # Run all tests (unit + integration)
make test-unit         # Run unit tests (fast, no database)
make test-integration  # Run integration tests (with database)
make test-common       # Run common package unit tests only
make test-graphql      # Run GraphQL API integration tests only
make test-editor       # Run Editor API integration tests only
make test-quick        # Run tests without cleanup
make migrate           # Run database migrations
make build             # Build Docker images
make build-prod        # Build production Docker image
make logs              # View logs
make shell             # Open container shell
make health            # Check API health
make lint              # Run code linting
make format            # Format code with black
make fix-lint          # Fix linting issues automatically

# UV commands
make uv-setup          # Initial UV setup
make uv-install        # Install dependencies with UV
make uv-run            # Run GraphQL API with UV
make uv-add            # Add new dependency
make uv-remove         # Remove dependency
make uv-lock           # Update lock file
make uv-sync           # Sync dependencies
```

### Production Safety

The Makefile includes production safety checks that prevent certain commands from running in production environments:

- **Test-only targets**: `test`, `test-quick`, `ci-test` - Always use test databases and are blocked in production
- **Development-only targets**: `build`, `clean`, `prune`, `logs`, `shell`, `editor`, `db-shell`, `db-list`, `dev-stop`, `lint`, `format` - Blocked in production for security
- **Production targets**: `prod-up`, `prod-down`, `prod-clean`, `prod-migrate` - Specifically designed for production use

### Environment-Specific Usage

```bash
# Development (uses .env.local)
make dev
make test
make build

# Production (requires environment variables to be set)
ENVIRONMENT=production make prod-up
ENVIRONMENT=production make prod-migrate
```

## API Endpoints

### GraphQL

- `POST /graphql` - GraphQL endpoint with rate limiting
- Queries: `getCategories`, `getCategory`, `getGuides`, `getGuide`
- Mutations: `submitFeedback`

### REST API

- `GET /health` - Health check with rate limiting
- `POST /dev-editor/categories` - Create category (dev editor)
- `GET /dev-editor/categories` - List categories (dev editor)
- `POST /dev-editor/guides` - Create guide (dev editor)
- `POST /dev-editor/media/upload` - Upload media (dev editor)

## Testing

The project uses a two-tier testing strategy for optimal performance and reliability:

### Unit Tests (Fast, Isolated)
```bash
# Run all unit tests (no database required)
make test-unit

# Run specific unit test
make test-common

```

### Integration Tests (Database Required)
```bash
# Run all integration tests (with database)
make test-integration

# Run specific API integration tests
make test-graphql      # GraphQL API tests
make test-editor       # Editor API tests

# Run full test suite (unit + integration)
make test

# Quick tests without cleanup (faster for development)
make test-quick
```

### Test Structure
```

1. **Smart Change Detection**: Only runs tests for changed components
2. **Parallel Testing**: Separate jobs for common, GraphQL API, Editor API, and integration tests
3. **UV Setup**: Reusable composite action for consistent dependency management
4. **Security Scanning**: Bandit and Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF upload
5. **Hybrid Deployment**: GitHub Actions for testing, Cloud Build for deployment (optional)
6. **Environment-Specific**: Staging (develop branch) and production (main branch) deployments

#### CI/CD Features

- **Path-based Triggering**: Only runs when relevant code changes
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel execution for faster CI
- **UV Caching**: Optimized dependency installation and caching

## UV Dependency Management

This project uses UV for fast, reliable dependency management with separate dependency groups:

### Benefits

- **Fast**: Faster than pip
- **Reliable**: Lock files ensure reproducible builds
- **Modern**: Similar to Maven/pnpm workflows
- **Container-friendly**: Works great in Docker with multi-stage builds
- **CI-optimized**: Better caching and faster builds
- **Group-based**: Separate dev dependencies for linting and testing

### Usage

```bash
# Setup UV (one-time)
make uv-setup

# Install all dependencies (production + dev)
uv sync

# Install only production dependencies
uv sync --no-dev

# Install specific dependency groups
uv sync --group dev

# Add dependency
make uv-add pkg=requests

# Remove dependency
make uv-remove pkg=requests

# Update lock file
make uv-lock

# Run application
make uv-run
```

### Dependency Groups

- **Production**: Core runtime dependencies
- **Dev**: Testing, linting, and development tools (pytest, flake8, black, etc.)

### Docker with UV

The project includes UV-optimized Dockerfiles for builds:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install uv (small Rust binary, <10 MB)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir uv

WORKDIR /app

# Copy lock + metadata only
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# Install directly from lockfile (deterministic)
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-editable

# Copy rest of app
COPY . .

CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "graphql-api.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

## Free Tier Limits

- **Neon DB**: 0.5GB storage, 10GB transfer/month
- **Redis**: 30MB memory, 30 connections (Redis Cloud free tier)
- **Google Cloud Storage**: 5GB storage, 1GB transfer/month
- **Google Cloud Run**: 2M requests/month, 400K GB-seconds compute
- **Vercel**: 100GB bandwidth/month

In layman's terms, this stack should cover a deep exploration without a penny.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Separated Services**: Clear separation between public GraphQL API and private Editor API
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of concerns with domain logic in `common/`
- **UV Integration**: Modern dependency management with lock files and dependency groups
- **Test Strategy**: Two-tier approach with fast unit tests and comprehensive integration tests
- **Connection Pooling**: AsyncAdaptedQueuePool for production, NullPool for tests
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-based with different limits per endpoint type
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs for observability
- **Docker-First**: All operations run in containers with UV-optimized builds
- **Production Safety**: Makefile blocks dangerous commands in production environments
- **Environment Validation**: Explicit validation of required environment variables
- **CI/CD Optimization**: Path-based triggering, parallel execution, and smart caching
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting, formatting, and import sorting with `make fix-lint`
